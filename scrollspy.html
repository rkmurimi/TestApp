				<h4>Chelsea Vs Spurs</h4>
				<p>A strike from Pedro and a Kieran Trippier own goal earned Chelsea a key win over Tottenham but 
				the BBC Sport audience opted for a Blues midfielder as man of the match.In our Player Rater page
				you gave Pedro an average mark of 7.47 out of 10 but the tireless energy of N'Golo Kante earned a mark of 7.66.
				Perhaps unsurprisingly, Kante performed more sprints than anyone on the pitch with 18, five clear 
				of his nearest rival - Tottenham's Moussa Sissoko.Chelsea's 2-0 win leaves them sixth, three points
				behind fourth-placed Arsenal with a game in hand. Tottenham remain third, nine points behind leaders Liverpool.</p>
				<h4>Chelsea Vs Fulham</h4>
				<p>Fulham caretaker manager Scott Parker says he is planning for the long term after his first match in charge
				ended in a narrow defeat by Chelsea.The Premier League strugglers produced a much-improved performance in their
				first game since the sacking of Claudio Ranieri, but remain deep in relegation trouble.With nine matches remaining,
				they are 10 points from safety and have lost eight of their past nine league games.
				"The most important thing was we showed character," said Parker. 
				"Our centre-halves got the ball and played. This is the way Fulham play and the way I want my team to play.
				"I am thinking long term in the best interests of Fulham. 
				I will treat this as long term because I want to help this club."</p>
				
				<h3 id="fa">@FA</h3>
				<h4>Chelsea Vs Manchester United</h4>
				<p>Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri said his team played "confused football" as Manchester United won
				at Stamford Bridge to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals.The result throws Sarri's reign deeper into crisis,
				while United delivered the perfect response to their first defeat under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to set up a
				last-eight tie against Wolves.Ander Herrera converted Paul Pogba's perfect cross to give United
				a 31st-minute lead, and Pogba doubled the advantage right on half-time when he dived to head Marcus Rashford's
				delivery past Kepa Arrizabalaga, who should have done better.As Chelsea slumped tamely to another
				damaging defeat, their fans turned on Sarri. They jeered his substitutions, mocked his 'Sarri-ball' philosophy,
				demanded the return of Frank Lampard as manager, and joined United's fans in chants of "you're getting sacked in the morning".
				"We played confused football in the second half but in the first half we played well," said Sarri.</p>
				<h3 id="carabao">@Carabao</h3>
				<h4>Chelsea Vs Manchester City</h4>
				<p>Manchester City won the Carabao Cup in a penalty shootout at Wembley after Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga
				defied manager Maurizio Sarri's attempt to substitute him.City claimed the first major trophy as they
				chase a historic quadruple but this stale final, which was goalless after extra time, will be remembered
				for an almost unprecedented challenge to Sarri's authority by Kepa.The £71m Spanish keeper,
				Chelsea's club record signing, had been struggling with cramp in the closing stages of 
				extra time and Sarri decided to send on substitute Willy Caballero, 
				who saved three penalties in a shootout to help Manchester City win this trophy against Liverpool in 2016.
				Kepa refused to come off and Sarri backed down in a rage - before City won the shootout,
				with Raheem Sterling scoring the decisive penalty.</p>
				<h3 id="europa">@Europa</h3>
				<h4>Chelsea Vs Malmo</h4>
				<p>Callum Hudson-Odoi scored a marvellous second-half goal as Chelsea cruised into the Europa League
				last 16 with victory over Malmo at Stamford Bridge.The Blues, who led 2-1 from the first leg,
				started slowly but improved markedly after the break.Olivier Giroud gave them the lead on the night by tapping home,
				before Ross Barkley floated in a free-kick moments after Rasmus Bengtsson was sent off.Hudson-Odoi, 18, 
				then drove in from the right before firing in a late third.Whether this result will ease the pressure 
				on Blues manager Maurizio Sarri remains to be seen.Their next two matches - against Manchester City
				in Sunday's Carabao Cup final, and Tottenham in the Premier League next week - will be bigger tests.</p>

				<p>Chelsea will give Argentine goalkeeper Willy Caballero, 37, a one-year contract extension.</p>
				<p>Fifa could prevent Chelsea's plans to launch a £200m summer spending spree before their transfer ban kicks in, 
					which could also stop the Blues chances of bringing in Zinedine Zidane as manager.</p>
				<p>Juventus could turn to former Chelsea boss Antonio Conte if Massimiliano Allegri leaves the Serie A giants this summer. </p>
